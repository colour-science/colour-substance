Colour - Substance
==================

Introduction
------------

**Allegorithmic Substance** implementation for `Colour <https://github.com/colour-science/colour>`__.

Substances
~~~~~~~~~~

Colour Matrix
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A basic colour matrix substance filter loaded with many RGB colourspace
transformations. The current preset transformations are intended to be used by
stacking two colour matrix filters together. It is however possible to generate
custom transformations by using this `App <https://www.colour-science.org:8010/apps/rgb_colourspace_transformation_matrix>`__.

A preset file is available in the
`repository <https://github.com/colour-science/colour-substance/blob/master/presets/colour-matrix.sbsprs>`__
along with an online `Google Colab Notebook <https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1dmxFClHWXMQFe5dUGIHhRL9YRo-dJvh4?usp=sharing>`__
to generate it.
